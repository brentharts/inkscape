HOWTO

# Add a LPE test:
  - create the svg file with some examples of the same LPE (clip, mask shape, path, group....
  - add the test in CMakeLists.txt
  - use 1.0 if posible as base to generarte files
  - store the file in "lpe_tests/expected" folder
  - copy also the file to "lpe_tests" folder open it in a text editoer and remove all d attributes of the file
 

# Fix a failing test (due to a change in code):
  - DO *NOT* MODIFY the expected rendering (or the svg) before getting advice from inkscape-devel@
  - fix your code if possible
  - manually double check the changes
