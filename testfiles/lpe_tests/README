This folder contains LPE to test. LPE test API has some parameters that can be helpful for fixing tests, especially legacy ones.
* inkscape:test-threshold="0.3" in the root SVG element set a precision to all the tests. If it's in a single element, add to it. If it doesn't exist, use a default one 0.0001
* inkscape:test-ignore="true" skip this element from testing
The method to create/refresh a LPE version test need update all LPE in document
THe only way I found work properly for ALL inlude legacy is:
1) Layer "LPE,s" xmleditor remove optgroup (no layer)
2) Select it, ungroup
3) Select all except bottom ones
4) Group
5) Mark as layer and rename back
6) Remove all not layers objects from meassure segments (in root) become recreated
