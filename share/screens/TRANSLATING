# Explaination

The start screen can sometimes have text placed upon it, these screens will
appear in the po file as `../screens/start-$name-text.svg` which is rendered
on top of the png file `../screens/start-$name.png` when the user interface
is loaded.

# Instructions

Each translation should be a seperate svg file, the goal of these instructions
is to create a translated version of the text. In this example we will be
translating the welcome-start.svg file for Inkscape 1.1 into Japanese.

## Step One: Get the file

The source files are kept in the media repository here:

https://gitlab.com/inkscape/vectors/content/-/tree/master/screens/welcome

 1. Navigate into the directory which has the same name as the version
    of Inkscape you are translating. In this example `1.1`
 2. Install all the fonts in the fonts directory, if it exists. You don't
    have to use these fonts, but they will let you see the original design
    in the way it was intended.
 3. Download the svg file. It contains the full design, not just the text.
    For this example we download `welcome-start.svg`

## Step Two: Edit the SVG

 1. Open the svg file in inkscape, the later the better.
 2. Open the layers dialog in Inkscape. You should see two layers, one 
    labeled `Text` and one `Base`. If you don't find a `Text` layer,
    this startup graphic might not have any text to translate.
 3. Make sure the Text layer is visible by pressing the eye in the layers
    dialog.
 4. Edit the text, try to keep to the same design, colours and spacing if
    possible. But if you need to use a different font, reorder things or
    make it more attractive in your language, please do.
 5. Convert the text to paths using `Path > Object To Path`
 6. Delete the Layer that is marked as `Base` so you only have the text layer.
 7. Run `File > Clean Document` to remove unneeded elements.

## Step Three: Saving and Comitting

 1. Save as a `Plain SVG` document in the screens folder. For our example the
    name will be `share/screens/welcome-start-text.ja.svg`
 2. Edit the translation in the po file so `welcome-start-text.svg` is now
    `welcome-start-text.ja.svg`
 3. Add the new file and the changes to the po file using git tools (see other
    instructions for how to commit and push merge requests or ask for help)
